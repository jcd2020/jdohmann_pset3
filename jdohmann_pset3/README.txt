NOTES FOR THE GRADER (if any):

I decided not to use mmap (except for the 1MB stride pattern test) because it seemed kind of like a shortcut to me. Additionally, most of the time I get blue or green for all of my tests but occassionally when I run it a test will show up red. The data seems to be noisy so there's not much to be done about that.
